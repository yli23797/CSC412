     a) Dropbox comment: location of code, group names
     b) Dropbox file:  Word file
            Compare solutions - ease of writing
                              - performance
                              - timing & speed-up tests
     c) Class account:
           Directory:  MatMul
              mmseq.c         <-- sequential
              mmpthread.c     <-- pthread
              mmomp.c         <-- openmp
              README          <-- how to build, run, test

Group programming project: matrix multiplication
  Implement sequential
  Implement parallel - ptheads
  Implement parallel - OpenMP


For well chosen square matrix, run timing tests
   - AFTER you verify correctness & fair testing

Vary size of matrix as well as number of threads
 -- if you go with "not square" make sure the
      matrix dimensions are appropriate

Draw some conclusions, make observations, ...

Can just use   %  time  ./a.out
   ** IF you are fair in initialization, set-up, etc.


Matrix can be provided
 - sample data files
 - random generation
 - hard coded  (bad idea for big matrix)
* Make it clear in your README how to test it
 - Matrix sizes
 - Matrix values
